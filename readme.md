# Flags
A collection of pride flags in the style of Twemoji.

Colors are taken from existing Twemoji emotes, and interpolated where a new color is required.

### üìÅ Structure
Each flag has its own dedicated folder. These contain:
- `<flag name>.psd`: The Photoshop document used to create the flags.
- `<flag name>.png`: A `1024x1024` image of the flag.
- `<flag name>.svg`: Vector graphic designed for web or scaling.
- `emoji.png`: A `500x500` optimized image designed for chat applications.

Where needed, a `notes.md` file exists outlining any non-standard changes.
